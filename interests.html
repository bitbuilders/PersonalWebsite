            <h2>What does Colin like?</h2>
            <p>
              Colin is a simple, yet amazing man. Anything he enjoys is also amazing, no matter the size of the list. With that being said, he generously gave me information to talk about him, so I will share with you the list of his top five interests.

            <h2>The importance of Colin's interests</h2>
            <p>
                Some may say, <q>What's the big deal? Everyone has interests</q>, and to that I say, HAH! If you truly believed that Colin is a celebrity, you would be in paradise reading this page right about now, but as a matter of fact, you don't. To fix that, and start you off as a 'Colin Believer', here are some .gif motion pictures of the amazing things Colin has done.

            <h2>Filler paragraph to make the page look nice</h2>
            <p>
                Colin hates bad-looking web pages. Because of that, there needs to be a paragraph here in order to fill the void of nothingness, and to enhance the overall glory that is Colin. That being said, I don't want this paragraph to be about nothing, so I will talk about how amazing Colin is. He once did something so cool, marvelous, and outright astounding, it made Simon Cowell not expressionless. Too bad Colin didn't go on American's got Talent, oh well, he doesn't need that mumbo jumbo to make him realize his greatness.
