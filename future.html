            <h2>What will Colin do next?</h2>
            <p>
                Since colin has done almost everying there is to do in life, at a young age too, he will most likely end up as a coder in either game developement, or computer science and earn millions of dollars. However, Colin has always aspired to be a Super Model. He was super close to being one as well, but just didn't take the opprotunity because he thought he would be too good.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                What Colin will do next is a mystery, but that's what makes him so amazing. He has said that he will become a coder since the age of 15, but he has no idea what he will do after, or during his coding career. I guess we will just have to wait and see.
