            <h2>Who is Colin Misbach?</h2>
            <p>
                Colin is a gorgeous, talented, and hardworking coding wizard. You are probably thinking right now, <q>WOW, there is nothing Colin can't do, and he is so beautiful while doing it</q>, if so, then you are correct. Now, I'm assuming you are a stalker because there is only personal information on this site, so I'll do all the heavy lifting for you and provide you with links to some of his personal information. For example, his interests, favorite websites, and his future plans. In case you are one of the few individuals who thinks Colin is just a bunch of hogwash, and probably wrote this paragraph himself in the third person, here is proof he is extremely popular and successful in the form of a jingle:

            <h2>Why a website about him?</h2>
            <p>
                There has to be a website about Colin, there should be nothing less. Granted, a website is mediocre compared to all the other things that could be done for the fabulous Colin Misbach, however, this is the bare minimum that a prodigy deserves.
